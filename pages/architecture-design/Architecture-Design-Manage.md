# Management Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture design for managing the infrastructure. It focuses on the configuration management and deployment automation aspects, ensuring that all components are properly managed and maintained. And also in domain controller centralization, allowing for a single point of management for user accounts, policies, and access control.

## Stakeholders

1. **System Administrators**: Responsible for managing the infrastructure and ensuring compliance with security policies.
2. **Application Support Team**: Responsible for managing application-related services and ensuring they are properly configured and maintained.
3. **Security Team**: Responsible for implementing and maintaining security policies, including access control and configuration management.

# Domain Controller Architecture Design

## Objectives

- Implement FreeIPA as the domain controller for centralized user management.
- Define user groups and host classifications to manage access and permissions.
- Establish Host-Based Access Control (HBAC) rules for secure access to services.
- Configure sudo rules for user groups to ensure appropriate permissions.

## How it benefits the organization

**Table 1**: Benefits of Domain Controller Architecture Design

| Benefit | Stakeholders | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Centralized management of user accounts and policies | 1, 2 | Allows for easier administration and enforcement of security policies. |
| Enhanced security through Host-Based Access Control (HBAC). | 1, 3 | Restricts access to services based on host and user groups, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. |
| Simplified user management with the ability to define user groups and permissions | 1, 3 | Enables efficient management of user access and permissions across the infrastructure. |
| Improved compliance with security policies by enforcing access controls and sudo rules | 1, 2, 3 | Ensures that only authorized users can perform administrative tasks, reducing the risk of security breaches. Introduce a granular minimum privilege. |
| Streamlined administration with a single point of management for user accounts and access control policies | 1, 3 | Reduces the toil of checking and managing user access across multiple systems, improving efficiency. |
| Reduced risk of unauthorized access by implementing fine-grained access controls based on host and user groups | 1, 3 | Enhances security posture by ensuring that only authorized groups can access specific services and resources. |

# Configuration Management Architecture Design

## Objectives

- Implement Ansible playbooks for automating the deployment and configuration of the VMs.
- Use Ansible roles to organize tasks and manage dependencies.
- Define infrastructure desired state.
- Integrate Ansible with the monitoring stack for automated alerts and reporting.

## How it benefits the organization

**Table 2**: Benefits of Configuration Management Architecture Design

| Benefit | Stakeholders | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Automated deployment and configuration management | 1, 2 | Reduces manual effort and ensures consistent configuration across the infrastructure. |
| Improved efficiency in managing infrastructure changes | 1, 2 | Enables quick and reliable updates to the infrastructure, reducing downtime and errors. |
| Security can be enforced through automated configuration checks | 3 | Ensures that security policies are consistently applied across all managed nodes, reducing the risk of misconfigurations. |
